Matrix Game for Introduction to Robotics ü¶æ
========================================

Introduction üìÑ
------------

Welcome to the Matrix Game aka Casoleta Gaming, a "console" game developed for the Introduction to Robotics course! This project was a challenge that opened my appetite for robotics and led me to buy my components to start working on my projects. During the realization of this project, I encountered various "problems" that I would not have encountered working on a smaller or simpler project, such as the need for more pins, conflicts generated by PWM dependency, and the use of dynamic allocation leading to unpredictable problems.

This project is a continuation of homework that we previously had during this course, a simple game that required a slow blinking dot for the player, a fast blinking dot for the bullet/bombs, and a simple dot for the walls. For this project, the previous game (a Bomberman wanna-be) had been upgraded with new mechanics, a menu, sound effects, and a high score system. From a physical point of view, we added more components, additional buttons, an LCD, and most important, a case to simulate a gaming console.

Game Description üéÆ
----------------

Casoleta Gaming is a portable "console" where you can test your gaming skills by playing a Bomberman-like game. Your goal is to destroy all the walls on the map smartly so you can achieve the highest score. You can choose from multiple difficulties and use special bombs to secure the top rank.

How to Play üß©
-----------

To play the Matrix Game, follow these steps:

1.  **Setup:**
    
    *   Then, you turn on the "console" you can choose to play the game, see the current high scores, change the settings(you can adjust the light for the LCD or the LED matrix, you can turn on or off the sound, and reset the high scores), see details about the creator of the project and read a short version of the game rules.
2.  **Game Rules:**
    
    *   Your goal is to destroy all the walls on the map without dying. You can move using the joystick, place bombs with the main button, and switch between the bombs using the right and left buttons.
3.  **Objective:**
    
    *   Get the highest score by destroying the wall using bombs. You have unlimited explosion bombs, but destroying multiple walls at a time offers you a better score! You can also use special bombs that come in a limited number to place walls.
4.  **Winning:**
    
    *   You win the game when all the walls are removed.
